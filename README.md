# Data Structures and Algorithms in TypeScript

This project demonstrates data structures and algorithms using TypeScript. It is designed to understand how common data structures work and how to implement basic algorithms from scratch.

## Overview

Data structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing tasks. Understanding both is essential for writing efficient and effective code.

- **Arrays**: The [Arrays/array.ts](Arrays/array.ts) file shows how to create and manipulate arrays.

- **Arrays Algorithms**: The [Arrays/arraysAlgs.ts](Arrays/arraysAlgs.ts) file shows how to apply searching and sorting algorithms on arrays.
