# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript

This project demonstrates fundamental data structures and algorithms using JavaScript. It is designed to help learners understand how common data structures work and how to implement basic algorithms from scratch.

## Overview

Data structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently. Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems or performing tasks. Understanding both is essential for writing efficient and effective code.
